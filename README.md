- Project status: [POC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept)
- Screencast: https://youtu.be/9oih7cZTjk4
- Docker Image: https://hub.docker.com/r/stephaneklein/gibbon-mail (Automated Builds configured on `master` branch)

To generate PDF instead send mails, see this project: [gibbon-pdf](https://github.com/stephane-klein/gibbon-pdf)

## Why this project?

- I would like to move transactionnal mail engine from my application in a separate service
- I would like to allow humans to send email manually, via a simple application plugged to the same API.
- I would like to keep a history (optionally) of all mail sent

## Docker Image

[`stephaneklein/gibbon-mail:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/stephaneklein/gibbon-mail/builds) Docker Image is automatically builded when [`master` branch](https://github.com/stephane-klein/gibbon-mail/tree/master/) is updated.

## This project is based on this stack

- [Backend](backend/):
  - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Koa](https://koajs.com/)
  - [`mjmlio/mjml`](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml) to generate Html email
  - [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) to fill Email templates
  - [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com) to send email
  - [Swagger](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) (see [swagger.yaml](backend/src/swagger.yaml) file)
- [Frontend](frontend/)
  - [ReactJS](https://en.reactjs.org/), [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), [React-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
  - [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form) to generate Form from JSON Schema (need Bootstrap version `v3.3.6`)
  - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## FAQ

### How can I enable Authentication system?

This project hasn't build-in authentication system, it's a internal service in your stack,
you must protect it by a private network or [Basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) system.

### How does the multi-language support works?

Inside your mail templates folders, you can create multiple languages files for the same email, in the following format: `{lang}.(mjml|subject|txt)`.

You also need to let a default file in case the language is not found or no language is requested.

So, for example, your folder should look something like this:

```
$ ls mail-templates/mail-example
default.mjml       default.subject             fr.txt            de.mjml           de.subject          es.txt
default.txt        fr.mjml                     fr.subject        de.txt            es.mjml             es.subject
```

Then, you can add the `lang` property to the body of your request, which will send the email with the requested language if it exists.

For example, the following body will try to send a german email:

```
{
  "from": "no-reply@example.com",
  "to": "john.doe@example.com",
  "lang": "de"
}
```

If the `lang` property is not present in the body of your request, the default email will be sent.

### Why « Gibbon-mail » name?

[Gibbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbon) as an allusion to [Mandrill App](https://mandrill.com/).

### How can I keep an archive of all mails send by Gibbon-mail?

Configure `BCC` variable env as below example to send all mails send by Gibbon-mail to `log@example.com` email account.

```
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.7"
services:
  gibbon-mail:
    image: stephaneklein/gibbon-mail:latest
    ports:
     - 5000:5000
    volumes:
     - ../mail-templates/:/templates/
    environment:
      SMTP_USERNAME: user
      SMTP_PASSWORD: password
      SMTP_HOST: mailcatcher
      SMTP_PORT: 1025
      BCC: log@example.com,test1@example.com
```

Or you can pass it to the body of the request as `bcc`.

### Why can I configure two smtp service?

Gibbon-mail support two smtp server configuration, for instance:

```
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.7"
services:
  gibbon-mail:
    image: stephaneklein/gibbon-mail:latest
    ports:
     - 5000:5000
    volumes:
     - ../mail-templates/:/templates/
    environment:
      SMTP_USERNAME: user
      SMTP_PASSWORD: password
      SMTP_HOST: mailcatcher
      SMTP_PORT: 1025
      SMTP_LABEL: "Send mail to Mailcatcher"
      SMTP2_USERNAME: user
      SMTP2_PASSWORD: password
      SMTP2_HOST: example.com
      SMTP2_PORT: 25
      SMTP2_LABEL: "Send mail with example.com smtp server"
      BCC: log@example.com
```

You can use `SMTP2_URL` for instance on staging environment: by default, you send mail to Mailhog fake smtp server et optionnaly on real smtp server to test your mail template rendering on several email clients.
